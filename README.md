# BitAgere - A Multi-Agere Interconnected System

![Feedback-loop](images/feedback-loop.png)

## Introduction

A next-generation, multi-dimensional consensus framework built upon Bitcoin’s secure and decentralized foundations. BitAgere leverages the “Control–Computation–Communication” (Cognito) model to achieve adaptive, evolving consensus beyond traditional blockchain paradigms.

## Architecture Overview
BitAgere’s layered structure combines:

BTC Main Chain Anchor:
Provides a secure, trustless baseline for global state commitments.

Programmable Sidechains (BEVM):
Enables flexible smart contracts, dynamic consensus adjustments, and new asset models.

Off-Chain Virtual Machines:
Handles high-dimensional data processing, agent-based simulations, and complex optimization tasks.

Multi-Agent Interactions:
Agents (Agere) leverage beliefs, desires, and intentions to form strategies, trade resources, and evolve reputations.
